# Kaggle Blue Book Bulldozers Competition Project



## Overview

Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost have become very popular in solving tabular(structured) data problems and gained a lot of tractions in Kaggle competitions lately. It has its very deserving reasons. However, in this article, I want to introduce a different approach from fast.aiâ€™s **Tabular** module leveraging:
> **Deep Learning and Embedding Layers.**

This is a bit against industry consensus that Deep Learning is more for unstructured data like image, audio or NLP, and usually not suitable for handling tabular data. Yet, the introduction of embedding layers for the categorical data changed this perspective and weâ€™ll try to use[ fast.ai](http://fast.ai)â€™s tabular module on the [Blue Book Bulldozers Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview) on [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) and see how far this approach can go.
